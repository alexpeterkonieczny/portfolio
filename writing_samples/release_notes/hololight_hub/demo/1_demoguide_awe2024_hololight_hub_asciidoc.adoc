<<<

== Introduction
First of all, thank you so much for demonstrating Hololight Hub at the Augemnted World Expo 2024. This demo represents months of work and years of planning on the part of many of your coworkers at Hololight. Hololight Hub is a major step for Hololight, making the process of remote rendering of mixed-reality content easier, more intuitive, and deployable to any of a vast array of devices that support the Hololight Hub client. It represents the opportunity for a company's IT department to host a library of ultra-powerful applications and make them instantly available to any number devices with ease. This user guide will help you prepare and lead a demonstration designed to communicate this vision to every visitor that comes to Hololight's booth at AWE.

This demo is designed to highlight specific features of Hololight Hub running on an on-premises server. However, this demo is not a complete implementation. Becasue of this, it is important to read this guide before showing the demo and understand what you are able to showcase. Only the features in the walkthrough below are available. Trying to push past what's in the walkthrough could either lessen the impact of the demo on the visitor or potentially cause the demo to not work and require maintenance. Of course, feel free to highlight Hub features you feel are relevant to the visitor as well as not focus on the parts of the demonstration as best fits the situation or audience. 

<<<

== Important Notes
- Do not try to change the applications running on the server.
- Do not try to change the metadata on the web server database.
- Do not try to change the structure, content, or appearance of the web browser application.

== Equipment
Included in the appendix is an xref:appendixEquipment[equipment list]. Use this list to make sure you are ready to go with all the necessary equipment before you head out to AWE. You should also use this list when prepping the demo, cleaning up afterwards, accounting for all the equipment before coming back home, and then again when you are back to ensure all of our equipment can be used effectively at AWE and into the future.

Since there are two setups of the demo, there are two sets of equipment. "Setup count" shows you how many of a given piece of equipment is needed for one setup. "Total count" shows you how many of that piece of equipment you have in total. 

An entry for a hotspot is included in the equipment list, but you will not bring it with you from Ismaning since we don't have one. You will need to find ane purchase one in the United States.

=== Labels
In the "Label" column, some label names will have a "#". On the printed labels a number takes the place of this symbol, either a "1" or a "2", letting you know which demonstration setup the item belongs to. For example, in the equipment list, the label is listed as "HOLO SWITCH #", meaning that there is a network switch labelled "HOLO SWITCH 1" belonging to Setup 1 and a switch labelled "HOLO SWITCH 2" belonging to Setup 2.

Lastly, equipment may also have a label, either "Private Room 1" for Setup 1 or "Private Room 2" for Setup 2. 

<<<
== Set up demonstration
This section gives step-by-step instructions for preparing a demonstration setup. Following this process in this order is the best way to ensure that all the equipment works correctly. Remember that there is enough equipment to put together two independent setups. Each piece of equipment is already labelled.

=== Hardware
Before you can test any of the software, you will need to first set up the hardware. Take care to follow these instructions to avoid any issues. You can then make sure that all devices are powered on and off safely.  

==== Power strip
You should first find the perfect place for your power strip. Make sure it is both as hidden as possible while still being accessable. 

*Do not turn it on yet.*

<<<

==== Network (Switch, gateway, access point, hotspot)
You should then set up the network. The network allows all the devices required for the demonstration to connect and communicate with one another. Use the diagram below for quick reference on how to connect the different parts together.

image:hololighthub_awe2024_demo_networkdiagram_20240524.png[,480]

===== Switch
Set up the switch. Between the two setups, there are two different models of switch. The equipment list in the appendix clarifies this. Connect the power cord to the switch and plug it into the power strip.

<<<

===== Gateway
Now set up the gateway. On the back are two ports. Connect an ethernet cable to the port with two arrows and the other end of that cable to port 1 on the switch. Attach the power cord and plug it into the power strip.

image:hub_awe2024_demo_gateway_ports.png[,480]

===== Access Point
Next, you need to set up the access point. This allows wireless devices to connect to the network. Underneath the device is an ethernet port. Attach an ethernet cable to this port and the other end to port 6 on the switch. 

===== Hotspot
If you have a hotspot, you need to plug it into the remaining port on the gateway. This will enable internet access.

===== Power on and test
If everything is properly connected, switch on the power strip to start the network. Wait for the blue light of the access point to glow. From the moment it is powered on, the network could take up to 20 minutes to start. To test if the network is working, see if the setup's assigned iPad can connect to the network. If a hotspot is connected, see if you can browse the internet using the successfully connected iPad. Which iPad should connect to which network is shown below.

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|*Demo setup*
|*iPad*
|*Network name*

|Setup 1
|"Private Room 1"
|HUB-AWE-1

|Setup 2
|"Private Room 2"
|HUB-AWE-2
|=== 

<<<

==== Server machine
The server runs the applications the clients connect to, as well as running the web browser application you view with the iPad.

image:hololighthub_awe2024_demo_serverconnections_20240524.png[,480]

To set up the server machine, first start at the back of the machine, pictured above. Connect your ethernet cable to the port marked with an arrow. Using any other port will not work. Connect the other end of the ethernet cable into port 7 of the network switch.

Continuing on the backside of the server machine, connect both power cables to the top two ports. You must connect both of these. If only one is connected, the machine will beep continuously when you power it on. If this happens, make sure the two power cable connectors are fully inserted. If both power cords are fully-connected the beeping will stop.

Go to the front of the machine. Open the door and you will see a white power button. Press this button and the machine will turn on. Close the door. From here you shouldn't need to do anything else with the server machine itself. All the software installed on the server will start automatically. This can take between 5 and 10 minutes. 

<<<

==== iPad
The iPad is used to show the web browser application that allows users to manage their applications.

Each iPad is preconfigured to connect to its assigned network, if the network is running. If it doesn't connect xref:troubleshootIPadConnect[see the troubleshooting section].

The demonstration requires the iPad to run in landcape mode. Turn the iPad to make sure the orientation cannot change. If the iPad switches between portrait and landscape orientation xref:troubleshootIPadLock[see the troubleshooting section].

To test the server machine, open Safari. You should see two bookmarks, "Hololight Hub" and "Hololight Hub - RESET". If the bookmarks don't appear, click the address bar at the top of the Safari or open a new tab. If there are still no bookmarks xref:troubleshootIPadBookmark[see the troubleshooting section].

The bookmarks allow easy access to the web browser application. Select the "Hololight Hub" bookmark. If the server is fully initialized and running correctly, you should now see the landing page for the Hololight Hub web browser application.

If when navigating the different pages of the web browser application the text or sizing of images looks unreadable or incorrect xref:troubleshootIPadSize[see the troubleshooting section].

==== Laptop

// The laptops are preconfigured to connect to the network if the network is running. If it doesn't connect see the troubleshooting section.
A laptop is needed at each setup for three reasons:

. Providing a server for the Taqtile Manifest application.
. Allowing mixed-reality capture for the HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap 2.
. Accessing and troubleshooting issues with the server. 

Alex and Philipp are responsible for providing and setting up these laptops.

==== Monitor

Use the monitor to show visitors not wearing a mixed-reality headset what the device is displaying.

. Set up the monitor by plugging it into the power strip.
. Plug the Chromecast into HDMI input 1.

<<<

==== Chromecast

image:hub_awe2024_demo_device_chromecast.jpg[,320]

The Chromecast is for displaying a video capture stream of the Meta Quest 3 when running your demonstration. Connect it to one of the monitor's HDMI ports and connect the Chromecast to the setup's network. In addition, the Chromecast needs a connection to a power source using the included power supply.


<<<

==== Mixed-reality devices

=====  Connect to application server using the Windows Remote Desktop application
If the .rdp file you need won't work or isn't available, you can use Windows Remote Desktop Connection to open a remote desktop window and fix the application. To open Remote Desktop Connection, press the Windows key (between left Ctrl and left alt), type "Remote Desktop" or "Remotedesktopverdindung", and open the program that appears.

==== Restarting the application
Though largely the same process, there a small differences in how to restart each of the applications. Below are instructions for each of the different situations you might encounter.

===== Restarting Space or Taqtile
When the remote desktop window appears it will show a familliar Windows desktop. You may or may not see the app running. Either way we either want to restart or start the app in order to see if a restart solves the connection problem.

image:hololighthub_awe2024_demo_troubleshooting_appreset_remotedesktopview_20240524.png[,480]

On the desktop is a file named "AppRestartBatch". Double-click this file and if the app is running it will close, and in either case a new instance of the app will start

image:hololighthub_awe2024_demo_troubleshooting_appreset_remotedesktopview_resetshortcut_20240524.png[,160].

The process won't take long. When the application appears, close the remote desktop window.

<<<

===== Restarting Frontline
When you remote desktop into the server for Frontline the screen will be completely black. This is because it is in full screen. Press the Windows key (between left Ctrl and left alt) to  Restarting Frontline is almost the same as restarting Space,

Press the Windows key to open the Start menu. Then select "File Explorer".

Select "Desktop".

<<<

Double click "AppRestartBatch".

<<<

===== Restarting NVIDIA Omniverse

image:hololighthub_awe2024_demo_troubleshooting_appreset_omniverse_00_20240524.png[,480]

NVIDIA Omniverse is only different in that the application runs in Unity, and when you double click "AppRestartBatch" on the desktop, the application will take longer to restart.

<<<

=== Web browser application isn't working correctly
Use a .rdp file to remote into the web server. Like the other applications it will look just like a normal windows desktop. From here just restart Windows as you notmally would.

=== Restart the machine
If problems persist despite trying everything described above, you should get in touch with one of the Hololight engineers in the contact section. If none of them are available you can try the following on your own.

==== Remote access restart
This is the safest way to restart the machine, but should only be done by a Hololight engineer.

{counter:stepsRemoteAccessRestart}. Using a laptop, connect to the network for your demo setup.

<<<

{counter:stepsRemoteAccessRestart}. Open the Google Chrome browser. In the address bar at the top enter the IP address that corresponds to your setup and network.

image:hololighthub_awe2024_demo_troubleshooting_vmware_01_20240524.png[,480]
{counter:stepsRemoteAccessRestart}. Wait for the server machine to shut down. The fans will become very quiet, moving only every so often. The blue power light will also be off. A green light will blink every now and then.

{counter:stepsRemoteAccessRestart}. Press the power button on the server machine to power it on the same way you did when setting up the demo.

<<<

==== Power button shut down
Go to the front of the server machine. Open the door. Press the white switch once and the machine will start to shut down. The fans will make a significant amount of noise, but then become very quiet, only moving very little every so often. The blue light will also be off, and there will only be a green light that blinks every so often. At this point press the power button again to power on the machine in the same way as you did when setting up the demo.

==== Power button hard shut down
If the machine does not respond to simply pressing the power button once, instead press and hold the power button for 12 seconds. The machine will then instantly power off, the blue light will go out, and only the green light will blink every so often. At this point press the power button again to power on the machine in the same way as you did when setting up the demo.
